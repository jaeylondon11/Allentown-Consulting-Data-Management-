# Validation and Verification

## Data Validation Checks
- Verify row counts between source and target databases.
- Ensure data types match between source and target.
- Confirm data integrity through sample checks.

## Verification Process
1. Run validation scripts to compare source and target data.
2. Perform manual verification on a subset of the data.
3. Document any discrepancies and resolve issues before finalizing migration.
